# Krant
Article CMS for an amateur newspaper.
This project's front-end is in **dutch**. This repository accepts dutch besides english.

## Deployment
Copy the entire repository to a folder on a webserver with PHP â‰¥ 5 and MySQL installed.

Enter the required info, at least the MySQL credentials, in the `serverconfig.example.php` file, and rename it to just `serverconfig.php`. `config.php` generally does not need to be configured.

To set up the database, use `krant.sql` (this defines all the required tables).
